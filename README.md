# NJForum Website 

NJForum is an extension to the pre-existing site known as NJSRHUB or www.srhub.org. NJForum provides additional features such as public forums and surveys, creating posts, and inserting comments, which updates the connected database accordingly. The main purpose of this implementation is to create a more interactive and engaging experience for all users. Our final product is a web page that will have forums, surveys, posts, and comments from users. The forum topics include Environment, Community, Logistics, etc. The front page of the website lists all the forum titles, posts, and comments. It also has a button that takes the user to the SR Hub website. The user has the option of logging into the site or signing up for an account. Once they do this, they will be taken to a page where they can insert posts and comments to interact with the various forums. There will also be a tab called Surveys, that will allow members of the community and users of the site to answer questions about how they are impacting the community. For each topic, there will be a survey category with related questions. A sample question is, “To what level have you integrated reusable products into your daily life? (i.e. reusable water bottles,  reusable straws, recycled grocery bags, etc)”. We will have different levels of users, with different authorization levels. Unregistered users will not be able to take surveys or to insert posts/comments.
